<p>After earning a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University, I took a job with a company that developed fuzes (as in ordnance, where they spell fuze with a “z”.) I wrote a lot of simulation software and designed a few optical systems. I worked with some interesting folks, such as the man who led the development of the world’s first sea-skimming missile. I even learned a little Hebrew. But I wanted more coding, so I moved on.</p>
<p>I found a position as a programmer with Primavera Systems, a vendor of project management software. I threw myself into an ocean of old FORTRAN code and did a great job maintaining and enhancing increasingly large portions of it. I also created (in C) the first version of their Custom Report Writer.</p>
<p>The advent of MS Windows at Primavera caused a huge shift in development, and eventually I was included in a series of layoffs as the company restructured its talent pool.</p>
<p>I landed at a small data processing company, where I still work. My responsibilities in this position are astoundingly diverse, but I still often find myself massaging data (both in my day job and as a consultant.) The most interesting thing I did recently in this job was moving the company into the AWS Cloud.</p>
<p>For almost two years, I’ve been going deeper into data science by exploring areas new to me, such as Machine Learning and Computional Neuroscience, and in the process strengthening my proficiency in subjects I learned years ago as an engineer (statistics, linear algebra, vector calculus, etc.)</p>
<p>I’m looking for opportunities to bring order out of chaos and help others grow.</p>
